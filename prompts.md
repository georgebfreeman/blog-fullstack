### Help me understand a section/block of code/file (in Claude.ai)
```text
I've attached the screenshot of my code from a file called `[name-of-the-file]`. Imagine you're a senior developer walking a beginning developer through this code.

Given this, walk me through this code step-by-step assuming I don't have prior context.

Here's the steps to follow:
- First review the screenshot close
- Understand all the concepts required
- Assume I'm a beginner in the langauge
- Include an additional resource(s) that will aid my understanding
- You write in markdown
```
